Based on data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2020, Indonesia is the third largest coffee producer in the world. Indonesia's coffee export value reached its peak in 2012 at $1.2 billion. Since then, coffee exports have shown a decreasing trend until 2020.

The decline in export value is attributed to the decreasing quality of Indonesian coffee beans, which can be caused by various factors such as genetic factors of the coffee plants, the growing environment, and the harvesting process. Therefore, there is a need for technology that can detect the quality of coffee beans to improve the marketing of Indonesian coffee products.

To address this issue, an application has been developed with the aim of detecting the quality of coffee beans. 

Click, which stands for Coffee Quality Check, is a mobile application that uses machine learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Network, to detect the quality of coffee beans and classify them into different grades. 

This application features several functions, such as 
- login-register-profile-logout, 
- news page, 
- detection page, 
- and quiz page. 
It is expected that this application will provide benefits to its users.

Within the application, there is valuable information related to coffee beans that can be beneficial, especially for coffee farmers. It's important to note that this application is the result of collaboration among various learning paths. CC handles the back-end development and storage of the application, MD develops the application from design to its final form, and ML manages the models and datasets used. 

We sincerely hope that this application will bring many benefits to everyone, particularly coffee farmers.

~Warm regards from the Click team.
